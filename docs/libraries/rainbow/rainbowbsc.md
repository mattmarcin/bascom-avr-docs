# RAINBOWBSC

This lib is based on the rainbow 1.2 lib from Galahat. See also : <http://bascom-forum.de/mediawiki/index.php/Rainbow_Lib>

The rainbowbsc.lib is essentially the same lib providing the same functionality. Some code is moved to CONFIG RAINBOW, and the routines are renamed in order to to give conflicts with existing/future statements/functions.

See [CONFIG RAINBOW](config_rainbow.md)
