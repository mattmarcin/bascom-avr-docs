# BIPOM MINI-MAX/C

The BiPOM MINI-MAX/AVR-C board from [www.bipom.com](<www.bipom.com>) can be set into PROGRAM and RUN modes.

In programming mode, the board uses the STK500V2 protocol for program downloads.

Selecting the BiPOM MINI-MAX/AVR-C programmer and the COM port is sufficient. Baud rate is fixed at 115200 baud.

The IDE automatically handles switching between PROGRAM and RUN modes.

If you press F4, the board will be put in PROGRAM mode, the firmware will be uploaded, and the board will be set back to RUN mode.
