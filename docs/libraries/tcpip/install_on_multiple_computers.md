# Installation on multiple computers

The following applies to the licensed version and the license key.

You may install BASCOM on multiple computers. For example on your laptop and your desk PC. There is no limit to the number of PC's you install the software on.

But you may only use one PC at the same time. Since you can only operate one PC at the same time, this is not a real restriction.

When you install on multiple PC's and others work on these PC's at the same time as you, you need multiple licenses!

The same applies for all the add-on libraries/products you purchase. 

We do not want to bother customers with anti piracy dongle and internet controlled licenses.
