# Registration

The software must be registered in order to get updates. This is explained in the [Updates](updates.md) topic.

We want to emphasize that it is important that you register soon as possible, at least within 1 year after purchase.

When you do not register timely, the license will not be approved. This means that you can no longer update the software.

Of course the software keeps working as is. It does not depend on the registration. But when you need support, we check if you use an actual version.
