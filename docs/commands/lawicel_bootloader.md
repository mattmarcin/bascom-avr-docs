# Lawicel BootLoader

The Lawicel Boot loader must be used with the StAVeR. The StAVeR contains a boot loader so you only need a serial interface, no parallel programmer or other programmers.  
  
You can also use Hyper terminal.

When you have selected the Lawicel Boot loader from the Options, Programmer, the following window will appear when you press F4.

As the window suggests, press the reset button on the activity board or StAVeR, and the chip will be programmed. This is visible by a second wind that will be shown during programming.

When the programming succeeds, both windows will be closed.

When an error occurs, you will get an error message and you can clock the Cancel button in order to return to the Editor.

THIS PROGRAMMED IS MARKED FOR REMOVAL. Send a note to support if you use it.
