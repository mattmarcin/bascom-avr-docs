# Application Notes

When you want to show your application at our web as a reference example on what you can achieve with BASCOM, we like to show it at our web, but of course with your permission.

We never publish anything without your explicit permission.

AN's are also welcome. When you developed a great AN you want to share with other BASCOM users, just send it and we will make an AN out of it. It is important that the comment in the source is in English. 

You can also share your code at the MCS Electronics user forum.
