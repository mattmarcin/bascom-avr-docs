# PULSEOUT

Action

Generates a pulse on a pin of a PORT of specified period in 1uS units for 4 MHz.

Syntax

PULSEOUT PORT , PIN , PERIOD

Remarks

PORT | Name of the PORT. PORTB for example  
---|---  
PIN | Variable or constant with the pin number (0-7).  
PERIOD | Number of periods the pulse will last. The periods are in uS when an XTAL of 4 MHz is used.  
  
The pulse is generated by toggling the pin twice, thus the initial state of the pin determines the polarity.

The PIN must be configured as an output pin before this statement can be used.
