# Getting Started

During the Development of the Bascom FT800 library, the following FT800/LCD hardware was used:

Model | Company | LCD Type/Size | URL  
---|---|---|---  
Gameduino2 | excamera | 4.3" resistive touch display  | [excamera.com/sphinx/gameduino2](<http://excamera.com/sphinx/gameduino2/> "Gameduino2")  
4DLCD-FT843 | 4D Systems | 4.3" resistive touch display  | [www.4dsystems.com.au](<http://www.4dsystems.com.au/> "4D Systems")  
VM800C35A | FTDI | 3.5" resistive touch display | [www.ftdichip.com](<http://www.ftdichip.com/> "FTDI")  
VM800C43A | FTDI | 4.3" resistive touch display  | [www.ftdichip.com](<http://www.ftdichip.com/> "FTDI")  
VM800C50A | FTDI | 5.0" resistive touch display | [www.ftdichip.com](<http://www.ftdichip.com/> "FTDI")  
  
Minimum Microcontroller requirements would be ATMEGA328P or an Arduino.

These boards are very common and are good value for money for any beginner who wants to start learning.

For the Advanced or Professional it would be advisable to chose a micro with plenty of Flash (>32k). 

If using a microSD/SDHC (with AVR-DOS) a good start would be 4KB of SRAM (>2KB)

Have a look at the various [DEMO's](demos.md). The Help shows the output you should get.
