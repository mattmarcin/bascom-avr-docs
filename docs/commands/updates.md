At the top you can see which products are registered and which status they have.

When you want to do an update you need to do a FULL SETUP, you need to download the full version. LIC files for partial updates are no longer offered.

You do not need to uninstall a previous version. You can install an update into the same directory or a new directory. 

We recommend to install into a new folder. 

When you uninstall a previous version, it will remove the license file which is not part of the setup.exe

![notice](notice.jpg)So in the event that you do run uninstall first, make a backup of the license dll named bscavrL.DLL

For BASCOM, the ZIP file you download contains only one setup.exe. You need to run this executable. 

It is also important that you put the license DLL into the same directory as setup.exe

Setup will copy this file to the BASCOM application directory. You can also manual copy this file.

The license file is on CD-ROM, diskette, or the media (email) you received it on. It is only supplied once.

Without the file, BASCOM will not run. 

The file is named bscavrL.DLL for BASCOM-AVR

When you got the license by email, it was zipped and probably had a different extension. Consult the original installation instructions.

The file is only provided once, we can not, and do not provide it again.

Add-on products can contain multiple files like lib, bas, pdf, etc.

See [Installing BASCOM ](installation.md)on how to do a full install.

IMPORTANT

![notice](notice.jpg)As of version 2080, the Update Wiz is phased out. This means that you need to download and install the full setup.exe

The BASCOM-IDE has a new simplified update method. See also [Help, UPDATE](help_update.md)
