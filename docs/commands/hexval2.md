# HEXVAL

The HEXVAL library contains an enhanced version of the HEXVAL code. The library was made by MWS.

The default HEXVAL function does not ignore spaces. The routine from the hexval.lib does ignore spaces.

It will also set the ERR flag to 1 if invalid characters are found. Valid characters are 0-9, A-F,a-f

Usage : $lib "hexval.lbx"
