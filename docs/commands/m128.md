\- When using XRAM and IDLE, the micro need the CONFIG XRAM after returing from the power down mode.

\- The register mapping for PORTF is not in sequence. Which means that PINF, DDRF and PORTF are not placed in memory after each other. This has some impact on some of the functions that use the ability. 1wire and soft i2c for example. But also serin will not work. It is best to use PORTF for normal digital tasks.
