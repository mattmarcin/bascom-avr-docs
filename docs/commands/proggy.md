# PROGGY

PROGGY is a popular USB programmer written by Red_Mamba.

You need to install it and make sure that the registry key :

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Red_Mamba\Atmel programator exists with the parameter : InstallPath

InstallPath should point to the executable which name is atme.exe

When you install PROGGY, it will be handled for you. When you have an older version, you need to update.

BASCOM will call the programmer with the following options : -p -s -e

The -e will cause the programmer to exit after the programming.
