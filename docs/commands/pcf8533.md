COLOR LCD

Color displays were always relatively expensive. The mobile phone market changed that. And [Display3000.com](<http://www.display3000.com>) , sorted out how to connect these small nice colorfully displays.

You can buy brand new Color displays from Display3000. MCS Electronics offers the same displays.

There are two different chip sets used. One chip set is from EPSON and the other from Philips. For this reason there are two different libraries. When you select the wrong one it will not work, but you will not damage anything.

LCD-EPSON.LBX need to be used with the EPSON chip set.

LCD-PCF8833.LBX need to be used with the Philips chip set.

Config Graphlcd = Color , Controlport = Portc , Cs = 1 , Rs = 0 , Scl = 3 , Sda = 2

Controlport | The port that is used to control the pins. PORTA, PORTB, etc.  
---|---  
CS | The chip select pin of the display screen. Specify the pin number. 1 will mean PORTC.1  
RS | The RESET pin of the display  
SCL | The clock pin of the display  
SDA | The data pin of the display  
  
As the color display does not have a built in font, you need to generate the fonts yourself.

You can use the [Fonteditor](font_editor.md) for this task.

A number of statements accept a color parameter. See the samples below in bold.

LINE | Line(0 , 0) -(130 , 130) , Blue  
---|---  
LCDAT | Lcdat 100 , 0 , "12345678" , Blue , Yellow  
CIRCLE | Circle(30 , 30) , 10 , Blue  
PSET | 32 , 110 , Black  
BOX | Box(10 , 30) -(60 , 100) , Red
