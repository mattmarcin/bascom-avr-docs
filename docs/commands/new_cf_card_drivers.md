# New CF-Card Drivers

New CF-Card drivers can be made relatively simple.

Have a look at the supplied drivers.

There are always a few files needed :

•| A config file in the format : CONFIG_XXX.bas  
---|---  
  
•| FlashCardDrive_XXX.LIB  
---|---  
  
•| FlashCardDrive_XXX.lbx is derived from the LIB file  
---|---  
  
XXX stands for the name of your driver.

At the AVR-DOS web you can find more drivers.
