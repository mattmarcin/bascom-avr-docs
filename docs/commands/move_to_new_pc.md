# Move to new PC

When you want to move BASCOM to a new PC. You have a number of options.

1 - Run the installer with admin rights from CD-ROM on your new PC. The setup will copy the license file automatically.

2 - Download the latest version of the setup.exe from <https://register.mcselec.com > , extract the setup.exe , and run setup.exe with admin rights

For the register link above, you need access(an account). This account is not the same as for the shop/forum.

You need to create an account if you don't have one. 

This procedure is explained in the help topic '[Updates](updates.md)'

After the installation, copy the license file bscavrL.DLL to the bascom-avr application directory of the new PC.

Or let setup.exe do this for you. When you put the license file in the same directory as setup.exe, setup will copy/install the file for you.

In general it is always better to install the latest version.

Support is only offered on the latest available version.
