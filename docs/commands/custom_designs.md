# Custom Designs

MCS does produce hardware to support special options. Like the [EM4095 Reference Design](em4095_rfid_reader.md) or the TCP TWI motherboard and adapter boards. We try to avoid SMD parts. In some cases this is not possible however.

For a prototype or small series, through hole components are simple to use. We do this with the hobbyist in mind. So our reference designs use little SMD parts too.
