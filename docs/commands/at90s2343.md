When using the AT90S2343 with BASCOM-AVR 1.11.6.4 and the STK200. Programming must be done with jumper ext-clk.

The BASCOM build in programmer will detect a Tiny22, which seems to have the same ID string as the 2343 (Atmel source) so no wonder.

By using the internal clock RCEN=0, then the jumper of the STK200 must be on int.clk after programming.

Don't leave this away, some AT90S2343 will not correctly startup.

In your own project notice that you have to pull up the clk pin(2) at power up else it won't work. (I just looked for it for a day to get this problem solved:-)

Note : the at90s2343 and tiny22 have the same chip ID. In BASCOM you need to choose the tiny22 even if you use the 2343.

I note from MCS : only the AT23LS43-1 has the internal oscillator programmed by default! All other 2343 chips need an external clock signal. Tip: use a AT90S2313 and connect X2 to the clock input of the 2343.

Using the AT90S2343 with BASCOM 1.11.7.3 the DT006 hardware there are no problems with programming the chip ie no special jumper conditions to enable programming. However it is best to remove links connecting ports to the DT006 LEDâs before programming. If access to PB3 and PB4 is desired then jumpers J11 & J12 must be installed with pins 2 and 3 linked in both cases. Note that PB3 and PB4 are each connected to a momentary pushbutton on the DT006 board. These can be used to check contact closure functions, so bear this in mind when writing code for contact monitoring.

The current ATMEL data sheet specifies that all versions â1, -4 and â10 are supplied with a fuse bit set for the internal clock that operates at approximately 1Mhz. If using the internal clock make sure to enter 1000000 under Options\Compiler\Communication\frequency.

A great little chip with minimal external components. Only the resistor and capacitor required for RESET during power up.

Note that the LEDâs on the DT006 are not connected to the same programmed port pins when changing the chip type. This is because the special functions assigned ports varies between the 8pin, 20 pin and 28 pin products eg the MOSI, MISI and SCK functions are assigned to PB0, PB1 and PB2 for an 8 pin processor and PB5, PB6 and PB7 for a 20 pin processor. The result is that for a given program the LEDâs that respond are different.
