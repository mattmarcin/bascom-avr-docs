A special toolbar is now visible.

You must press the Program enable button to enable the programmer.

When you enable the programmer the right baud rate will be set.

When you are finished you must press the Enable button again to disable it.

This way you can have a micro connected to your COM port that works with a different BAUD rate.

There is an option to select between FLASH and EEPROM.

The prompt will show the current mode which is set to FLASH by default.

The buttons on the toolbar allow you to :

ERASE, PROGRAM, VERIFY, DUMP and set the LOCK BITS.

When DUMP is selected you will be asked for a file name.

When the DUMP is ready you must CLOSE the LOGFILE where the data is stored. This can be done to select the CLOSE LOGFILE option form the menu.
