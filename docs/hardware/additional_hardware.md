# Additional Hardware

Of course just running a program on the chip is not enough. You will probably connect many types of electronic devices to the processor ports.

BASCOM supports a lot of hardware and so it has lots of hardware related statements.

Before explaining about programming the additional hardware, it might be better to talk about the chip.

[The AVR internal hardware](avr_internal_hardware.md)

[Attaching an LCD display](attaching_an_lcd_display.md)

[Using the I2C protocol](using_the_i2c_protocol.md)

[Using the 1WIRE protocol](using_the_1_wire_protocol.md)

[Using the SPI protocol](using_the_spi_protocol.md)

You can connect additional hardware to the ports of the microprocessor.

The following are hardware related:

[I2CSEND](i2csend.md) and [I2CRECEIVE](i2creceive.md) and other I2C related statements.

[CLS,](cls.md)[LCD,](lcd_2.md)[DISPLAY](display.md) and other related LCD-statements.

[1WRESET](1wreset.md) , [1WWRITE](1wwrite.md) and [1WREAD](1wread.md)

There are many more hardware specific statements and functions.
