# File Save

With this option, you save your current program to disk under the same file name.

The file name is visible in the Windows caption of the edit window.

If the program was created with the [File New](file_new.md) option, you will be asked to name the file first. Use the [File Save As](file_save_as.md) option to give the file another name.

Note that the file is saved as an ASCII file.
