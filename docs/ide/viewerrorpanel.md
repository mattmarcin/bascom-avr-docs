# View Error Panel

This option will show the Error panel.

![view_error_empty](view_error_empty.png)

When there are no errors, the list will be empty. You will also be able to close the window.

When there are errors :

![error_panel_error](error_panel_error.png)

You will not be able to close the window until the error is solved and the program is checked/compiled.

The panel is dockable and by default docked to the bottom of the IDE.

When you right click the mouse inside the error panel, a menu will popup with one option : Copy to Clipboard. All data from the error window will be copied to the windows clipboard if you select this option.
