# File Open

With this option you can load an existing program from disk.

BASCOM saves files in standard ASCII format. Therefore, if you want to load a file that was made with another editor be sure that it is saved as an ASCII file. Most programs allow you to export the file as a DOS or ASCII file.

Note that you can specify that BASCOM must reformat the file when it opens it with the [Options Environment](options_environment.md) option. This should only be necessary when loading files made with another editor.
