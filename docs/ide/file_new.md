# File New

This option creates a new window in which you will write your program.

The focus is set to the new window.

You can have multiple windows open at the same time.

Only one window can have the focus. When you execute other functions such as [Simulate](program_simulate.md) or [Program Chip](program_send_to_chip.md), BASCOM will use the files that belong to the current active program. This is in most cases the program which has the focus.
