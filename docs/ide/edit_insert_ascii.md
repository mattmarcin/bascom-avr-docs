# Edit Insert ASCII

This option will show a pop up window from which you can select an ASCII character.

In BASCOM you can embed ASCII characters by using brackets embedded with the ASCII code like : {065}

For example : Dim S As String : S="AB{067}"

This is the same as S="AAA"

The pop up lists shows all ASCII values and when you click the OK-button, the brackets are added.
