# Help Credits

BASCOM was "invented" in 1995. Many users gave feedback and helped with tips, code, suggestions, support, a user list, and of course with buying the software.

The software improved a lot during the last 25 years and will so during the next decade.

While it is impossible to thank everybody there are some people that deserve credits :

•| Peter Maroudas. He wrote and tested the FT80x FTDI display support. FT800 support would not exist without him.
