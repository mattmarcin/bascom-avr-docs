# Tools Resource Editor

The resource editor can be used to edit the resource strings of your application.

The resource editor will create a <project>.BCR file.

The resource editor is part of the Resource Add On, and is only available when you have this add on installed.

The simplest way to get the resources from your application is to create a BCS file using the DUMP option.

Then import them with the resource editor.
