# Help Index

Shows the BASCOM help file.

When you are in the editor window, the current word selected or by the cursor will be used as a keyword.

Notice that when the help window is small, you might need to make the help window bigger to show the whole content.

![notice](notice.jpg)The help contains complete sample code and partial sample code. 

In all cases the samples are shown to give you an idea of the operation. When trying a program you should always use the samples from the SAMPLES directory. These are updated and tested when new versions are published. The (partial) samples are not all updates, only when they contain errors. So the samples from the help might need some small adjustments while the samples form the SAMPLES dir will work at least on the used chip.
