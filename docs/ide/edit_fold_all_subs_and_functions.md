# Edit Fold All Subs and Functions

When Code folding is enabled in [Options, Environment, IDE, Editor](options_environment.md), this options will fold/collapse all sub procedures and functions.

Other structures that can be folded with F11 remain unaltered.

Using SHIFT+F11 or CTRL+ENTER, you can fold/unfold the current block.

Consider this example :

![code_fold1](code_fold1.png)

Both the Sub and For/Next can be folded but the Fold All Subs and Functions option, will only fold the sub :

![code_fold2](code_fold2.png)
