The project explorer window is intended to be used in project mode. Project mode is a mode where all files belong to one project. Here you have a main file and optional include files. 

The project explorer is a dock able window. It lists all files assigned to the project. When you double click a file, it will be opened in the editor. 

\- Use the ADD button to add files to the project

\- Use the REMOVE button to remove files from the project. Files you remove are only removed from the project, they are not removed from disk
